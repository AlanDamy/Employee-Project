I made this for an assignment for a course at George Brown College.
The objective was to create code that uses teh visual studio Console application to run the program.
It consists of the main which contains all the visuals and loops and statements,
a Employee Class which creates an employee along with there unique ID, first and last name, their annual salary, and residence(this part was to be aggregated from the another class)
the last one is the Residence class, this calss collects and stores all the information about an employee's address, this class is aggregated to the employee class
